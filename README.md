# EDA_White_Wines

This project is based on the Udacity course: [**Data Analysis with R**](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651)

### OBJECTIVE
The task is to conduct your own exploratory data analysis on a chosen dataset and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice. The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.
